  <!-- <h1>About</h1>
  <p class="bigger">Prior to <span class="centered"><img class="image-style" src="assets/logo_simple.png" /></span>the only way to enjoy a truely remarkable steak was to go to an expensive steakhouse or wait a 7-10 days for a steak to arrive from who knows where. How about the grocery store you might ask? It's not even close - their steaks are not in the same universe as our steaks. We age every steak, they age none. Most of our steaks are USDA Prime, theirs aren't. This is why we started <span class="centered"><img class="image-style" src="assets/logo_simple.png" /></span> - to bring you the best steaks at reasonable prices.</p> -->

  <!-- <h1>About Us</h1> -->
  <p class="question">What makes your steaks so good?</p>
  <p class="answer">Most of our meat is USDA Prime, which is the highest quality cut available. We also age our meat for 4 weeks to let it tenderize and give it that unbelievable flavor. Try it for yourself.</p>
  <p class="question">What does your 100% satisfaction guarantee mean?</p>
  <p class="answer">If you don't like our meat for any reason, let us know and we will give you a 100% refund. Simple as that. However, we do not cover theft so make sure there is a safe place for us to leave your package.</p>
  <p class="question">Is there a minimum order amount?</p>
  <p class="answer">Nope.</p>
  <p class="question">Is your meat sourced locally?</p>
  <p class="answer">Our meat comes from local Chicago packing companies but the meat is not sourced locally. Because of our very high standards, meat is handpicked from the best farms across the US. To put it into perspective, the best restaurants and hotels source their meat from the same place we source ours.</p>
  <p class="question">Do you deliver in my area?</p>
  <p class="answer">Check <a href="/availability">here.</a></p>
  <p class="question">How long do the steaks last for?</p>
  <p class="answer">All steaks are vacuum sealed which give them a lot of duration. You can leave the steaks in the fridge for 10 days or in the freezer for an entire year.</p>
  <p class="question">What time will my order arrive?</p>
  <p class="answer">Orders arrive between 1pm and 3pm on your scheduled delivery date.</p>
  <p class="question">What if Iâ€™m not home when my order arrives?</p>
  <p class="answer">All of our steaks are delivered in special coolers with ice packs to make sure the steaks stay fresh for at least 12 hours from the time we drop them off. However, we strongly recommend putting the steaks in your fridge or freezer by 10pm.</p>
  <p class="question">How are restaurant prices calculated?</p>
  <p class="answer">We scoured through steakhouse menus, found the average price and then added a 17% gratuity to it.</p>
  <p class="question">Do your steaks come raw or cooked?</p>
  <p class="answer">All steaks come raw.</p>
  <p class="question">Can I find your meat at the local grocery store?</p>
  <p class="answer">No, not only do many grocery stores not carry USDA Prime, but they also don't age their meat. Aging tenderizes meat and gives it that rich, mouthwatering flavor.</p>
  <p class="question">Does your meat come frozen?</p>
  <p class="answer">No, all meat is cut to order and delivered fresh. Mmmmm.</p>
  <p class="question">The steaks look a little brown, why?</p>
  <p class="answer">All steaks are vacuum sealed to preserve freshness. The lack of oxygen gives the steaks this color - but it's 100% normal. As a matter of fact, when you take the steak out of the packaging you will see it start to change back to its "original" color.</p>
  <p class="question">How do I cook your steak?</p>
  <p class="answer">Make sure the steak is fully thawed if you had it in the freezer. Start by seasoning the steak on all sides. Next, throw the steak on a very hot grill; depending on the thickness and what temperature you like, it cooks for about 3-4 minutes per side. If you're cooking a thicker steak, like a filet mignon, cook on medium for about 6 minutes per side. We recommend using a meat thermometer to check the temperature and caution eating undercooked meat.</p>
  <p class="question">Is your meat grass-fed?</p>
  <p class="answer">If it is, it will say in the description. However, most steak enthusiasts actually believe that grass-fed meat doesn't taste as good as corn-fed meat.</p>
  <p class="question">Why are you only selling 6 types of steaks?</p>
  <p class="answer">We decided we were going to keep it simple and only offer the most popular and delicious cuts for now.</p>
  <p class="question">What if I want something that's not on the menu or I have a large order?</p>
  <p class="answer">Send us an email and we will work with you to make it happen.</p>
